			<p>
				If you've commissioned a software solution in the past, your experience is most likely a combination of frustration at a flawed product, along with a degree of satisfaction that a problem has been solved in a way that no off the shelf product could achieve.</p>
			<p>
				How can businesses gain a competitive advantage through their own software without unreasonable risk? The answer lies in a software of measurable quality. 
			</p>
			<p>				
				FULL STACK offers bespoke software based on rigourous software quality models. Whether web, mobile or desktop, our software solutions are led by our belief in the power of data to both describe and demonstrate software in-use. The software solutions team measure and deliver on:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The quality of software in-design [Planning]</li>
				<li>The quality of software in-production [Build]</li>
				<li>The quality of software in-use [Live Use]</li>
			</ul>

			<h2><img src="img/services-icon-systems.png" /><span>Systems Architecture</span></h2>
			<p>
				Just as a building is defined first by its architect, and a suit by its tailor, a software system's entire presence and pattern is subject to the whim and wisdom of its architect. How can you ensure a quality software product? It all starts with the architecture. 
			</p>
			<p>
				How can you ensure that your system's architecture is of a high quality? Let FULL STACK provide our detailed levels of technical and functional specification that we perform prior to the commencement of our own projects with your problem set. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Whether an existing piece of software, or a new build, let FULL STACK provide you with insights into your problem set, along with proposed solutions to ensure that your investment in software has a high return.

			<p>
				Are you concerned that the software and technology in your business is out of control? Have you lost faith and trust in those advising you on what to purchase and how to leverage your investments already made? 
			</p>
			<p> 
				As our core belief is in the power of software to enable competitive advantage, we aid organisations to leverage technology. Often we do this via the provision of an independent assessment of the technology in-use or planned within an organisation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This can be an important tool to make the right investments. With over three decade sof executive experience in technology, we can help provide an independent view on the systems and services powering your business, either prior to new investments or to assess ROI on past investments.</p>

			<p>
				Does your development team need a refresh? Are your in-house resources feeling downtrodden or have lost motivation? Do they need to be inspired and receive a booster-shot of industry leading practices to improve their output?
			</p>
			<p>
				We want businesses to feel the power of software to unlock value through high quality software. We work hard every day to do that for our clients and ourselves. 
			</p> 
			<p>
				To do that, we are more than happy to work with in-house development teams to diagnose problems and encourage uptake of best practices in terms of methodology, technology stack and work behaviour. We don't have all the answers - however, as a passionate developer-led company we might have just the right patterns, play and practices to extract greater productivity and passion from your development team.</p>
